  # Deploy uses only the project token (RAILWAY_TOKEN). No account token or railway link needed.
  # Get RAILWAY_TOKEN: Railway project (e.g. rails-client-server) → Settings → Tokens → create token for the "dev" environment.
  # Project tokens are scoped to one project+environment; the CLI deploys to that target. Use --service when the project has multiple services.
